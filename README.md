# British-Airways-Customers-Experience
The British Airways Customer Reviews Analysis through Web Scraping project is a data analysis project that aims to extract valuable insights from customer reviews of British Airways using web scraping techniques. The project involves scraping customer reviews from the website https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways, that provide a wealth of information about customer experiences and feedback about various airlines.
The project will begin by using web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup, to extract customer reviews and relevant metadata such as ratings, reviews and review titles .
The next step will be to clean and process the data to remove irrelevant information, such as spam or duplicate reviews, and to standardize the format of the reviews for further analysis. The cleaned data will then be analyzed using natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information such as sentiment, topics, and opinions using NLTK, ROBERTA Model and VADERS.
The analysis will provide insights into areas that customers are happy with and areas that require improvement, such as customer service, food and beverage, or in-flight entertainment. The project will also identify patterns in negative reviews that relate to issues such as flight delays, lost baggage, or cancelled flights.
The findings from the analysis will be used to inform decision-making and help British Airways improve their customer service, operations, and overall customer experience. For instance, the project may recommend changes to the check-in process, a revamp of the in-flight meal service, or improvements to the baggage handling process. The project will also provide valuable insights into customer expectations and preferences, which can be used to develop targeted marketing campaigns and product offerings.
